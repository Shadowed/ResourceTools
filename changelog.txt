Improved CPU profiling detection, will only let you use CPU profiling enabled features after a reloadui instead of right after /rt cpu
Cleaned up the /rt event code, will handle multiple events better and will also accept "all" even with multiple events passed.
Added /rt ui for toggling the new profiling window
Added a profiling UI that lets you view total CPU/Memory of all addons, along with profiling all of the functions inside a namespace, you can also view the time taken and how many times all of the events were called.

Search boxes can be used to narrow down what functions or events will be shown.

Fixed /rt event not accepting multiple events when separated by a comma.
Fixed /rt func not matching regular functions instead of Foo.Bar formatted ones, also fixed no error message when the function didn't exist
Added an average seconds of time used for function and event profiling.
Added /rt reset to reset the CPU profiling stats
Added messages that the function or event was never called instead of showing 0 seconds, called 0 times.

Initial Commit.

Resource tools is for developers who want to profile their addon without having to mess around with the functions directly, you can access all of the profiling functions through /rt.
